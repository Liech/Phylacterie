# Phylacterie

This is the Programming Language called 'Phylacterie' based on Python and numbas llvmlite.

The goal is to recreate a language similar to c that allows experimental language constructs open for discussion.

The llvmlite Kaleidoscope example is used as base. 

The current state can be observed best by looking at [test.py](https://github.com/Liech/Phylacterie/blob/main/test.py)

While it may not serve as useable language in its current state it is a somehow clean and understandable starting point for your own languages.
